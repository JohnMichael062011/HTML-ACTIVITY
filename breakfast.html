<h5>Scrambled Eggs</h5>
<ul>
<li>3 large eggs
<li>1 tablespoon milk or water (optional, for creaminess or a lighter texture)
<li>1 tablespoon butter or oil
<li>Salt and pepper to taste
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>Beat the eggs: In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, milk or water (if using), salt, and pepper until just combined. Don't over-whisk.
<li>Heat the pan: Melt the butter or heat the oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat.
<li>Cook the eggs: Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Let it set for about 30 seconds before gently pushing the eggs from the edges toward the center with a spatula.

<li>Form the curds: Continue to pull and fold the eggs until they are mostly set but still slightly moist and creamy. Avoid stirring constantly.

<li>Finish and serve: Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the eggs to a plate. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired. The residual heat will finish cooking them.
