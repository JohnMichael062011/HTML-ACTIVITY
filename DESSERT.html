<h5>Leche Flan</h5>
<ul>
<li>
1 10 egg yolks

<li>1 can (300 ml) condensed milk

<li>1 can (370 ml) evaporated milk

<li>1 tsp vanilla extract



</ul>
<h5>Procedure</h5>
<p>To make leche flan, start by preparing the caramel: place the sugar in a llanera or small pan over low heat and let it melt until it becomes golden brown, then swirl gently to coat the bottom evenly before setting it aside to harden. In a bowl, lightly whisk the egg yolks, making sure not to create too many bubbles, then add the condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract, mixing gently until smooth. Strain the mixture at least once to achieve a silky texture, then pour it into the llanera with the hardened caramel. Cover the llanera with foil and steam it over low heat for 30–40 minutes, or until the flan is set and a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Allow it to cool completely, then refrigerate for a few hours. Finally, run a knife around the edges and carefully invert the llanera onto a plate to release the creamy, smooth leche flan.</p>
