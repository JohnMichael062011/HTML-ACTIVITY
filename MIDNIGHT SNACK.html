<h5>Procedure</h5>
<p>To make an egg sandwich, start by peeling the hard-boiled eggs and mashing them in a bowl using a fork until you reach your preferred texture. Mix in the mayonnaise, then season with salt and pepper, adding chopped onions, celery, pickles, or a small amount of mustard if you want extra flavor. Stir everything until well combined. Take two slices of bread and spread a generous amount of the egg mixture on one slice, then top it with the other. You can serve it as is, slightly toasted, or chilled, depending on your preference.</p>
