<h5>Fried Fish</h5>
<ul>
<li>
1 whole fish or fish fillets (tilapia, bangus, galunggong, or any fish you prefer)

<li>Salt

<li>Pepper

<li>Cooking oil

<li>Optional: calamansi or lemon, garlic powder, flour or cornstarch for extra crispiness

</ul>
<h5>Procedure</h5>
<p>To prepare fried fish, start by cleaning and rinsing the fish thoroughly, then pat it dry with a paper towel to prevent oil splatter. Season the fish with salt and pepper, adding calamansi or lemon and garlic powder if you want more flavor. Heat enough cooking oil in a pan over medium heat, making sure the oil is hot before placing the fish so it won’t stick. Carefully lay the fish in the pan and fry it for about 4–6 minutes per side, depending on its thickness, until the skin becomes golden and crispy. Once fully cooked, remove the fish from the pan and let it drain on paper towels to remove excess oil. Serve hot, optionally with vinegar dipping sauce or calamansi.</p>
