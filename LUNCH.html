<ul>
<li>500g chicken or pork
<li>1/4 cup soy sauce
<li>1/4 cup vinegar
<li>1/2 cup water
<li>4 cloves garlic (crushed)
<li>2 bay leaves (optional but recommended)
<li>1/2 tsp black pepper

</ul>
<h5>Procedure</h5>
<p>To cook simple adobo, combine the meat, soy sauce, vinegar, water, garlic, bay leaves, and pepper in a pot. Bring the mixture to a boil without stirring so the vinegar can cook properly. Once it boils, lower the heat and let it simmer until the meat becomes tender—about 25 to 30 minutes for chicken or 40 to 50 minutes for pork. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with a bit of salt or soy sauce if needed. Continue simmering uncovered until the sauce reduces and thickens to your desired consistency. Once done, serve hot with rice.</p>
